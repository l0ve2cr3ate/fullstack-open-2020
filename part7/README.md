### Exercises part7 routed-anecdotes

Exercises 7.1.7.3

7.1: routed anecdotes, step1
Add React Router to the application so that by clicking links in the Menu-component the view can be changed. At the root of the application, meaning the path `/`, show the list of anecdotes. The Footer-component should always be visible at the bottom. The creation of a new anecdote should happen e.g. in the path create.

7.2: routed anecdotes, step2
Implement a view for showing a single anecdote. Navigating to the page showing the single anecdote is done by clicking the name of that anecdote.

7.3: routed anecdotes, step3
The default functionality of the creation form is quite confusing, because nothing seems to be happening after creating a new anecdote using the form. Improve the functionality such that after creating a new anecdote the application transitions automatically to showing the view for all anecdotes and the user is shown a notification informing them of this successful creation for the next 10 seconds.
